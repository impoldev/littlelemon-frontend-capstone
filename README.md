# Front-End Developer Capstone: Little Lemon Restaurant

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Little Lemon Restaurant Booking System! This is the final project for the Meta Front-End Developer course hosted in Coursera platform. In this project, I have created a responsive website for the fictional restaurant **Little Lemon**, featuring a reservation booking system and a landing page that highlights some key offers and information about the business. The website is built using **React**, with a focus on clean design, user-friendly interactions, and effective front-end layout.

## Features

### 1. **Homepage**
- The homepage displays a hero section, specials, testimonials and key information about **Little Lemon**, such as its story and location.

### 3. **Booking System**
- Users can select a date, time, and number of guests to book a reservation.
- The system checks availability and allows users to submit their booking requests.
- Information about dates and times is kept in local storage.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- The website is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 5. **Unit Tests**
- App.test.js includes several unit tests.
